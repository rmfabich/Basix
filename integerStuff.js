//make the code work below by writing a function called "bananas" that accepts two integers and returns the sum of them. 

console.log(bananas(3, 4));
//7
console.log(bananas(666, 777));
//1443
console.log(bananas(1,0));
//1



//write a new function (call it whatever you want) that accepts three arguments - a string, an int, and another int. 
//The string will be a person's name. The function should return a string that says "Hello {name}, the product of your 
//numbers is {product of the two ints}." Console log the output to verify your function works. Keep in mind, the console log 
//should NOT be inside your function. Feel free to put console logs in there to test your code, but the final product should
//lack any console logs inside the function you create.
